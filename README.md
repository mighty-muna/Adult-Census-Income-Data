Performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the Adult Census Income dataset to uncover demographic and occupational factors influencing income levels. Conducted thorough data cleaning, univariate analysis to understand feature distributions, and bivariate analysis to explore relationships between categorical/continuous variables and income.
**Strengths Showcased:**
Data Cleaning & Preprocessing – Handled missing values, replaced placeholder characters, removed duplicates, and optimized data types to improve memory efficiency.
Exploratory Data Analysis – Conducted univariate analysis to examine distributions (age, education, occupation) and bivariate analysis to reveal correlations with income categories.
Feature Engineering – Encoded salary labels into binary format to enable quantitative comparisons.
Data Visualization & Interpretation – Created visual insights into salary distribution across gender, education level, and workclass, highlighting socio-economic trends.
Statistical Thinking – Used filtering, grouping, and aggregation techniques to answer targeted analytical questions (e.g., salary differences by gender, age ranges).
